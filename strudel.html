      <p class="text-gray-700 ">
        The STRUDEL design system emerged from the realization that across different science domains, scientists often want to use UIs to perform similar tasks. For example, many scientific users have a need to search through and filter tabular data, setup and configure computational codes, and monitor real time experimental data. Many of these UIs are developed as bespoke software, but I felt that there was an opportunity to create reusable and customizable templates that could encapsulate these common tasks and serve as starting points for new UI projects. I wrote up my thoughts on a design system for science in a <a target="_blank" href="./assets/designsystemsworkshoppaper.pdf" class="text-gray-800 underline underline-offset-4 hover:text-gray-900 decoration-fuchsia-400 hover:decoration-2">white paper</a> for a <a href="https://web.cvent.com/event/1b7d7c3a-e9b4-409d-ae2b-284779cfe72f/summary" target="_blank" class="text-gray-800 underline underline-offset-4 hover:text-gray-900 decoration-fuchsia-400 hover:decoration-2">DOE workshop</a>, which caught the attention of the Sloan Foundation. Through their <a href="https://sloan.org/grant-detail/g-2022-19360" class="text-gray-800 underline underline-offset-4 hover:text-gray-900 decoration-fuchsia-400 hover:decoration-2" target="_blank">generous grant</a>, the <a href="http://strudel.science" class="text-gray-800 underline underline-offset-4 hover:text-gray-900 decoration-fuchsia-400 hover:decoration-2" target="_blank">STRUDEL project</a> was formed and team assembled.

        <p class="text-gray-700">
          To develop the design system, we first gathered screenshots from several projects across multiple
          domains from throughout LBNL (focusing on LBNL for scoping purposes). We gathered additional
          context by interviewing the associated software teams. With these artifacts, we began clustering
          similar UIs and quickly identified common task types. From here, we designed templates that strip
          away domain-specific elements so they can be applied across different sciences. These are published
          on the STRUDEL website as Figma files, and several have been implemented as React templates.

        Design systems can focus on various levels of detail — from how a button should look like or how a data table should behave. We decided to focus on the higher level workflow that users do in order to accomplish a task, which we call <a href="https://strudel.science/design-system/task-flows/overview/" target="_blank" class="text-gray-800 underline underline-offset-4 hover:text-gray-900 decoration-fuchsia-400 hover:decoration-2">Task Flows</a>. We wanted to focus our efforts on a level that, in our experience, scientific users needed the most help on — how to think about how their users can accomplish a task using a web UI.

        <p class="text-gray-700">
          Our lofty goal with our design system was to empower scientists to create their own UIs, without needing much frontend skills. However, even with trying to simplify setup with configuration files and command line tools, we realized that we were falling short of our goal, with the skill gap being too large for many of our users. This is when we decided to experiment with AI agents to help our users close that skill gap. In October, we hosted a workshop on using AI with STRUDEL to develop science UIs. With over 30 in-person participants, we were extremely excited to see how much our users could accomplish in a single day, even users who had never written a line of code or used the command line.

          <BR>&nbsp;<BR>
          The elephant in the room in the era of AI is whether design systems like STRUDEL are even necessarily given that gen AI is capable of creating an AI with very little user feedback. Based on the feedback from the workshop, at least for now, users appreciate the sense of control and transparency that starting with a trusted resource provided, as a form of guardrails. Rather than relying entirely on the AI to generate the end product, users felt much more comfortable starting with a baseline and using the AI agent as a partner to incrementally move towards their goals. 
                    <BR>&nbsp;<BR>
          A surprisingly development was the sense of community and comraderie that was generated, as we all graple with how to best utitlize and integrate these new technologies in our work and lives. We saw participants helping each other, providing their advice and experiences, and wanting to continue to be a part of a learning community. Several particpants expressed wanting to continue the experience, by joining future workshops, attending ongoing meetings with like minded individuals (like the US-RSE UX working group), and contributing back to the STRUDEL project.
